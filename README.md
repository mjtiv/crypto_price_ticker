Crypto Price Ticker (Pings CoinGecko)

Created for fun to see if it was possible to create a self-updating ticker based a on a few coins.

If using a PC and python installed, download the script and install the required packages, then just double click on the ".py" file and it starts to run automatically. 

The speed of the self-update is slow because any faster and the script will "error" out due to CoinGecko's pinging limit.
